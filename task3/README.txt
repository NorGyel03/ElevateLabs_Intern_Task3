Task Objective
Implement and understand Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

STEPS: 
Import Libraries
Imported essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib.

Load and Preprocess Data
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Removed missing values.
Initialized dataset to observe available features.

Feature Selection
Picked features (independent variables) like area, bedrooms, etc.
Picked target variable (dependent variable) as price.

Train-Test Split
Split the data into the training set and the testing set (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing).

Model Building
Applied LinearRegression from Scikit-learn to develop the model.

Evaluation
Tested the model on metrics such as:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
MSE (Mean Squared Error)
RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

Visualization
Plotted the regression line on the data points for interpretation.
